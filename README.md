# mini-greenhouse-dnn-lstm-models
This is the repository to train the Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models as the black box model that will be combined with the physic-based model (the GreenLight) for the [mini-greenhouse-model](https://github.com/EfraimManurung/mini-greenhouse-model) system.
